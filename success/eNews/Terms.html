    <h1>Pica eNews&trade; Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <br /><br />
    <h2>Compliance rules for sending e-mail</h2>
    <br /><br />
    All Pica eNews&trade; customers must follow the rules of the federal CAN-SPAM act and Pica eNews&trade;’s <a href="AntiSpam.html" title="Pica eNews&trade; Anti-Spam Policy">Anti-Spam Policy</a> when sending e-mail through the service. Accordingly, we require the following of e-mail messages sent through the Pica eNews&trade; system:
    <br /><br />
    All e-mails must contain a one-click unsubscribe link as provided by the Pica eNews&trade; service. Pica eNews&trade; scans every campaign for the existence of an unsubscribe link. If an unsubscribe link is not detected, the user is informed and is required to include an unsubscribe link before continuing.
    <br /><br />
    All e-mails must contain non-Internet contact information of the sender, such as your company’s address, or your company’s phone number.
    <br /><br />
    All e-mails must state the reason the recipient is receiving the message. For example, “You are receiving this message from ABC Company because you signed up for our e-mail list at www.abc.com.”
    <br /><br />
    These 3 guidelines will help ensure that Pica eNews&trade; maintains its reputation and white-listing status with a number of major ISPs and whitelisting programs. If at any time your campaign is flagged as SPAM by an AOL recipient, Pica eNews&trade; reserves the right to cancel your account without notice.
    <br /><br />
    
    <h2>Email and Permission Practices</h2>
    <br /><br />
    Every email message sent in connection with the Services must contain an “unsubscribe” link or other mechanism that allows subscribers to remove themselves from your mailing list. Each such link must remain operational for a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which you send the message, and must be in form and substance satisfactory to Pica eNews&trade;. You acknowledge and agree that you will not remove, disable or attempt to remove or disable either link.
    <br /><br />
    You agree to import, access or otherwise use only permission-based lists (note: purchased lists may not be used; please contact Pica eNews&trade; if you have questions). You can mail up to 500 people without notifying us of concent. Above 500 subscribers, we require you to proove how you aquired your subscribers. If you try to send an email with more than 500 subscribers the system will not allow you to proceed untill you contact us and provide adequate proof each subscriber opted-in to your subscriber list. 
    <br /><br />
    You cannot mail to distribution lists, newsgroups, or spam email addresses.
    <br /><br />
    You are responsible for monitoring, correcting, processing unsubscribe requests within 10 days, and updating the email addresses to which messages are sent through your Pica eNews&trade; account.
    <br /><br />
    Emails that you send through the Service may generate abuse complaints from recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that your email campaigns do not generate a number of abuse complaints in excess of industry norms. Pica eNews&trade;, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether your level of abuse complaints is within industry norms, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes under this Agreement.
    <br /><br />
    Pica eNews&trade;, at its own discretion, may immediately disable your access without refund to the Services if Pica eNews&trade; believes in its sole discretion that you have violated any of the email and permission practices listed above, or the Pica eNews&trade; <a href="AntiSpam.html" title="Pica eNews&trade; Anti-Spam Policy">Anti-Spam Policy</a>.
